NAME
    Template::Plugin::Group - Template plugin to group lists into simple
    subgroups

SYNOPSIS
      # In your Template
      [% USE rows = Group(cells, 3) %]
  
      <table>
      [% FOREACH row IN rows %]
        <tr>
        [% FOREACH cell IN rows %]
          <td class="[% cell.class %]">[% cell.content %]</td>
        [% END %]
        </tr>  
      [% END %]
      <table>

DESCRIPTION
    Template::Plugin::Group is a fairly simple (for now) module for grouping
    a list of things into a number of subgroups.

    In this intial implementation you can only group ARRAY references, and
    they can only be grouped into groups of a numbered size.

    In practical terms, you can make columns of things and you can break up
    a list into smaller chunks (for example to chop a large lists into a
    number of smaller lists for display purposes)

METHODS
  new \@ARRAY, $cols [, 'pad' ]
    Although this is the "new" method, it doesn't really actually create any
    objects. It simply takes an array reference, splits up the list into
    groups, and returns the whole things as another array reference.

    The rest you do normally, with normal Template Toolkit commands.

    If there isn't a perfectly divisible number of elements normally the
    last group will have less elements than the rest of the groups. If you
    provide the optional parameter 'pad', the last group will be padded with
    additional "undef" values so that it has the full number.

TO DO
    - Support grouping HASH references

    - If everything in the list is an object, support group/sort by method

    - Support complex multi-level grouping (I have code for this already,
    but it needs to be rewritten and should probably be a separate plugin).
